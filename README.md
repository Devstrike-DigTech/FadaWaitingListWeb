#Fada  
##Find Any Drug Anywhere

The aim of the Fada waiting list website is to act as an existing tool to measure the success rate of the pre launch marketing or awareness creation of the platform to pharmacies. The website is a ‘waiting list’ website, akin to a ‘pre order’ in the launching of a product or commodity. The website aims to provide more information on the project, including details that could be omitted by the foot soldier marketers as well as serving as a more static source of information or source of truth for all parties involved.
It contains official information about the project and its team as well as information on the product as concerns pharmacies. It details out the various features of the product and their benefits as well as the various subscription plans and the features.
The website will also have a CTA (Call-To-Action) to the visiting pharmacy, to register to join the waiting list for the product, pending its release. To join the waiting list, the pharmacist fills out a form, entering details of their pharmacy including, the owner name, the contact information, as well as various branches, if applicable.
Every entry to the waiting list is attached to a list which runs from Alpha Batch (A-List) to Rogue (Others-List). In total, there are 4 list batches and their benefits are detailed further down in this document. All pharmacies on the waiting list will be informed directly with a personal link to register, when the product is launched.
When there is a definite launch date, the website will be populated with a countdown timer till the launch time.

The website is being created with ReactJs, Firebase Firestore backend, and other required libraries and frameworks, for Project Unisach under the authority of Devstrike Digital Limited.
